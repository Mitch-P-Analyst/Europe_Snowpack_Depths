We see a consistent gap between the aggregated series and the station-level / month-level medians, usually yielding a more negative slope for core months and more positive slope for fringe months from aggregations. This project does not dive into proving a directional distortion from aggregation, therefore for interpretation, report both summaries and state explicitly which one you reference."]),

Limited station counts also explain isolated non-significant tiles in the country-month and elevation-band heatmaps. Expanding to additional sources on Zenodo could strengthen coverage."]),
